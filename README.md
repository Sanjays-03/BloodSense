# Fingerprint Blood Group Detection Using Deep Learning

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Collection**: Fingerprint images are stored in the `dataset/` directory, organized into subfolders based on blood groups (e.g., `A+`, `B-`, etc.).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images are resized to `(128, 128)` pixels to match the input size of the CNN model.
  - Data augmentation is applied using `ImageDataGenerator` to improve model generalization:
    - Rescaling pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
    - Random rotations, shifts, shears, zooms, and flips.
    - Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- The CNN model automatically extracts features from fingerprint images:
  - **Convolutional Layers**: Detect patterns like ridges and minutiae in fingerprints.
  - **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features.
  - **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features to classify blood groups.

### 3. Model Training
- **Architecture**:
  - A Sequential CNN model with:
    - 3 convolutional layers (32, 64, 128 filters).
    - MaxPooling layers after each convolution.
    - A fully connected layer with 256 neurons and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
    - A final softmax layer for 8-class classification (blood groups).
- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: Adam.
  - Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy.
  - Metrics: Accuracy.
  - Trained for 15 epochs using the preprocessed dataset.

### 4. Evaluation
- The model is evaluated on the validation set:
  - Accuracy and loss metrics are used to assess performance.
  - Confusion matrices can be generated to analyze misclassifications.

### 5. Prediction
- The FastAPI backend handles predictions:
  - Uploaded fingerprint images are preprocessed (resized, normalized).
  - The trained model predicts the blood group.
  - The result is returned as a JSON response.

## Addressing Misclassifications

### Reasons for Misclassification
- Poor image quality (blurry or noisy images).
- Insufficient training data for certain blood groups.
- Overlapping features between different blood groups.

### Proposed Fixes
- **Data Augmentation**: Add more variations to the training data.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Collect more samples for underrepresented blood groups.
- **Model Improvements**:
  - Use a deeper CNN architecture.
  - Experiment with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- **Post-Processing**:
  - Add a confidence threshold for predictions.
  - Flag low-confidence predictions for manual review.
