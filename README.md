# 🔬 Fingerprint Blood Group Detection

This project is a **deep learning-based system** that predicts a person's **blood group** using **fingerprint images**. It includes:

- A **FastAPI backend** for handling fingerprint image uploads and model inference.
- A **Next.js frontend** for an interactive user experience.
- A **Deep Learning model (CNN)** trained to classify fingerprint images into different blood groups.
