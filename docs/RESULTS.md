  <p><em>Confusion matrix showing the model's performance across different blood groups</em></p>
</div>

The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's classification performance across different blood groups:

- **Strong Diagonal**: Indicates good overall classification performance
- **Off-Diagonal Elements**: Represent misclassifications between blood groups
- **Common Confusions**: 
  - Most confusion between A- and AB- groups
  - Some confusion between B+ and B- groups
  - Minimal confusion between positive and negative Rh factors within the same blood group

## Sample Predictions

Below are examples of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model:

### Correct Predictions

| Input Image | Predicted | Actual | Confidence |
|-------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| ![A+ Sample](../Ouput_images/a_pos_sample.png) | A+ | A+ | 96.2% |
| ![B- Sample](../Ouput_images/b_neg_sample.png) | B- | B- | 89.7% |
| ![O+ Sample](../Ouput_images/o_pos_sample.png) | O+ | O+ | 97.8% |

### Incorrect Predictions

| Input Image | Predicted | Actual | Confidence | Analysis |
|-------------|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| ![AB+ Misclassified](../Ouput_images/ab_pos_error.png) | A+ | AB+ | 76.3% | Low contrast in core area |
| ![B- Misclassified](../Ouput_images/b_neg_error.png) | B+ | B- | 68.2% | Partial fingerprint |
| ![O- Misclassified](../Ouput_images/o_neg_error.png) | O+ | O- | 72.1% | Blurry image with noise |

## Performance Analysis

### Strengths

1. **High Accuracy for Common Blood Groups**: O+, A+, and B+ groups are predicted with >88% accuracy
2. **Good Overall Balance**: Similar precision and recall values indicate balanced performance
3. **Robust to Minor Image Quality Issues**: Performs well with minor noise and rotations

### Limitations

1. **Rare Blood Group Performance**: Less common blood groups (AB-, B-) have lower accuracy
2. **Image Quality Dependency**: Performance degrades with poor quality images
3. **Limited Dataset Size**: Some blood groups have fewer training samples

## Comparison with Baseline

Comparing our CNN model with traditional approaches:

| Method | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **BloodSense CNN** | **86.0%** | **85.2%** | **84.7%** | **84.9%** |
| Traditional ML (Random Forest) | 73.5% | 72.8% | 71.9% | 72.3% |
| Traditional ML (SVM) | 71.2% | 70.4% | 70.1% | 70.2% |
| Statistical approach | 62.8% | 60.5% | 61.2% | 60.8% |

The BloodSense CNN shows a substantial improvement over traditional machine learning approaches, demonstrating the benefits of deep learning for this application.

## Error Analysis

### Common Error Patterns

1. **Quality-Related Errors**:
   - Blurry images reduce accuracy by 15-20%
   - Partial fingerprints increase error rate by 25-30%
   - Poor contrast affects core area feature extraction

2. **Inter-Group Confusions**:
   - AB groups often confused with their component groups (A or B)
   - Rh factor (+ vs -) distinction is more challenging than ABO type

3. **Low Confidence Predictions**:
   - 76% of errors are made with confidence below 75%
   - Implementing a confidence threshold could reduce incorrect predictions

### Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the error analysis, several strategies could improve model performance:

1. **Data Augmentation**: More aggressive augmentation to improve robustness against quality issues
2. **Class Balancing**: Targeted data collection for underrepresented blood groups
3. **Ensemble Approach**: Combining multiple models could improve rare class performance
4. **Feature Engineering**: Including explicit ridge pattern features as model inputs
5. **Confidence Thresholding**: Implementing a minimum confidence threshold for predictions
